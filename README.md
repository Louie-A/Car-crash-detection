# Vehicle Scratch and Dent Detection using YOLO v5 and TensorFlow

This repository contains a deep learning project that utilizes YOLO v5 and TensorFlow to detect scratches and dents on vehicles. The project aims to automate the process of identifying and localizing such damages, which can be useful for vehicle inspection, insurance claims, and maintenance purposes.

The project leverages the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection algorithm, specifically the YOLO v5 variant, which is known for its accuracy and efficiency. It uses a deep neural network trained on a large dataset of vehicle images to identify and classify scratches and dents. TensorFlow, a popular deep learning framework, is used for implementing the model.
